LaTeX Layout for SCS Publications
=================================
While not being legally bound to use the official layout for PhD theses completed at the Straubing Center of Science (Straubing, Bavaria, Germany) supervisors and professors generally recommend it for a uniform look.

Unfortunately, the complete definition of layout is available in form of a Word 2007 file (docx). Due to numerous shortcomings of this layout definition, the fact that it is exclusively available for Microsoft Word and the fact that the uniformity among the first ten volumes of the series is non-existant, we decided to do our theses with LaTeX and set up a framework document that contains everything as needed.

Who started that?
-----------------
We are the first two doctoral students of the chair for Chemistry of Biogenic Resources (and probably also the whole Straubing Center of Science) who refuse to write their PhD theses with Word.
